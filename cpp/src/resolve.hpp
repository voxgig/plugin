 * PURE. It returns the ids a host WOULD try, in order; it does not load
 * anything. That separation is what lets the corpus pin resolution in
 * every language including those with no dynamic loading at all — cpp
 * among them — and it is why §15.4 puts real module loading in per-port
 * integration tests rather than here. */
